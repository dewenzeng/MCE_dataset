### MCE dataset

The dataset contains 100 patients who received MCE from 2019/01/01 to 2019/10/30, who were referred to Guangdong Provincial Peopleâ€™s Hospital. For each patient, three MCE sequences (30 frames per sequence) are extracted in A2C, A3C and A4C chamber, respectively. All data are annotated by an experienced cardiologist by [Labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) tool.
Myocardial segmentation is a critical step in determining accurate region of interests (ROIs) in quantitative MCE analysis (e.g., myocardial perfusion analysis), an accurate automatic myocardial segmentaion model can help reduce the human effort and increase productivity.
